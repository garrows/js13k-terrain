# Terrain Generation

Try it live https://garrows.github.io/js13k-terrain/

This demo generates some terrain using the midpoint displacement algorithm. The implementation was borrowed from http://www.playfuljs.com/realistic-terrain-in-130-lines/ and modified to be a top down view.

It also uses https://github.com/dataarts/dat.gui for tweaking.
